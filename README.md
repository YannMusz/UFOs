## Summary: 

### Some Concerns:
The use and knowledge of specific entries such as shapes or dates need to be known by the user and require correct lower case spelling to be able to filter out results.

### Recommendation: 
1. Adding a trim function to catch spaces at the end of words as well as allow for upper and lower cases.

2.Adding in a filter function to include a date range as the filter to aid the user in better investigating UFO Sightings.
